This table contains all individual libraries processed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Support for different branches based on sequences covering diagnostic positions. Each shows percent support calculted by the number of sequences covering diagnostic positions supporting the relative branch over the total sequences covering diagnostic positions. Significant assignments (lower 95% binomial confidence >10% support) indicated with ""**"". Note that internal branches were not considered for assignment to a lineage. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lines with the same Index Library ID are due to multiple sequencing runs of the same library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All deamination rates were computed by looking at C->T substitutions on the three terminal positions of the 5' and 3' ends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
